<h2>Introduction</h2><p>With the movement towards reduced-serum and serum-free conditions for cell culture, defined formulations and low-protein alterna­tives are of increasing value. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is tradition­ally used as a supplement in media for cell and tissue culture at final concentrations of 5% to 10%. However, it can introduce risk as FBS lot-to-lot variation may negatively impact cellular and molec­ular studies, and can introduce artifacts due to the presence of unknown compounds, proteins, growth factors, and other unde­fined components<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, the high protein content of serum can introduce complications with protein purification. Corning<sup>®</sup> Nu-Serum™ growth medium supplements provide more cost-effective, low pro­tein alternatives that can be utilized as a 1:1 direct replacement for FBS in cell culture media.</p><p>In the first arm of this study, MRC-5 (human lung fibroblasts), were cultured in media containing either 10% FBS or 10% Corning Nu-Serum I to assess supplement performance. In the second arm, Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) were grown in media supplemented with FBS, or in media with Corning Nu-Serum IV. Cell morphology, doubling time, and viability over five consecutive passages were monitored. When used as a 1:1 direct replacement for FBS in cell culture media, Nu-Serum I and IV yielded stable cell doubling times and good cell viability that were comparable to the FBS-containing media controls.</p><h2>Materials/Methods</h2><p>MRC-5 cells (ATCC® CCL-171™) and Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81™) were thawed into Minimum Essential Media (MEM, Corning Cat. No. 10-010-CVR) containing 10% FBS (Corning Cat. No. 35-010-CV). Evaluation of media with either FBS, Nu-Serum I (Corning Cat. No. 355500) for MRC-5 cells, or Nu-Serum IV (Corning Cat. No. 355504) for Vero cells was initiated in Tissue Culture (TC)-treated T-25 flasks at passages 4-12. For each study, two T-25 vessels per condition were seeded with MRC-5 cells at 7.5&#215;10<sup>3</sup>-1.5&#215;10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm² or Vero cells at 3&#215;10<sup>3</sup>-5&#215;10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm² in 0.3 mL/cm² of MEM containing 10% final con­centration of either FBS, Nu-Serum I, or Nu-Serum IV, respectively. MRC-5 and Vero cells were cultured for 72 to 96 hours, depending on initial seeding density, at 37°c in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in a humidified cell cul­ture incubator. Cultures were monitored daily for cell morphology and confluence using an EVOS® FL Imaging System. Cells were harvested based on the confluence and morphology of the control flasks with media containing 10% FBS, regardless of the confluence of the flasks with Nu-Serum supplements. Cells were harvested with Accutase® cell detachment solution (Corning Cat. No. 25-058-CI) and centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated, and cells from replicate flasks were re-suspended in their appropriate media and pooled together for cell enumeration and viability measurements using a NucleoCounter® NC-200™ automated cell counter (ChemoMetec), and subsequent passaging. Each study continued for five sequential passages and was repeated three independent times.</p><h2>Results and Discussion</h2><p>To assess the ability of Corning Nu-Serum I and Nu-Serum IV growth medium sup­plement to directly replace FBS in cultures, the addition of 10% final concentration of Nu-Serum I/IV in MEM was compared to 10% FBS in MEM for five con­secutive passages of fibroblast/kidney epithelial cell culture using MRC-5 and Vero cells. Cell morphology and confluence was monitored daily, as well as cell counts and viable cell densities on the day of each passage.</p><p>During the course of the study, typical MRC-5 fibroblastic morphology was observed with media containing Nu-Serum I serum supplement, as directly compared to the FBS containing media control (Figure 1a). Typical Vero kidney epithelial morphology was observed with media containing Nu-Serum IV serum supplement being directly compared to the FBS-containing control medium (Figure 1b). MRC-5 and Vero cell confluence appeared similar between flasks with media containing 10% FBS, Nu-Serum I, and Nu-Serum IV serum supplements (Figure 1).</p><figure id="attachment_20391" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20391" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-20391 size-full" src="https://cellculturedish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Figure-1.-Representative-photomicrographs-depicting-MRC-5-and-Vero.jpg" alt="Representative photomicrographs depicting MRC-5 and Vero" width="692" height="598" srcset="https://cellculturedish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Figure-1.-Representative-photomicrographs-depicting-MRC-5-and-Vero.jpg 692w, https://cellculturedish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Figure-1.-Representative-photomicrographs-depicting-MRC-5-and-Vero-300x259.jpg 300w, https://cellculturedish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Figure-1.-Representative-photomicrographs-depicting-MRC-5-and-Vero-347x300.jpg 347w, https://cellculturedish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Figure-1.-Representative-photomicrographs-depicting-MRC-5-and-Vero-560x484.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20391" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.

The cultured cells in media containing 10% Nu-Serum supplements displayed comparable cell dou­bling times (Figure 2b, 3b) over the course of five passages, suggesting positive cell proliferation rates and no sign of strenuous growth condi­tions when using this media supplement. The similar cell doubling times also support visual assessment of high cell confluence of MRC-5 and Vero cells cultured using Nu-Serum I &amp; IV supplements when compared to FBS-containing media control.</p>
